Flask is a good choice for this. \n\nHere are the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary:\n\n1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application and the routes for our game.\n\n2. `game.py`: This file will contain the logic for the rock, paper, scissors game. It will have a `Game` class with methods like `play_round`, `get_computer_choice`, and `determine_winner`.\n\n3. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that will display the game interface to the user. It will have buttons for the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and it will display the result of each round.\n\n4. `static/style.css`: This is the CSS file that will style our HTML page.\n\n5. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our application needs to run.\n\nLet's start with the `app.py` file:\n\napp.py\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\nfrom game import Game\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\ngame = Game()\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef index():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        player_choice = request.form.get('choice')\n        computer_choice = game.get_computer_choice()\n        result = game.determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice)\n        return render_template('index.html', player_choice=player_choice, computer_choice=computer_choice, result=result)\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `game.py` file:\n\ngame.py\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Game:\n    CHOICES = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']\n\n    def get_computer_choice(self):\n        return random.choice(self.CHOICES)\n\n    def determine_winner(self, player_choice, computer_choice):\n        if player_choice == computer_choice:\n            return 'It\\'s a tie!'\n        if (player_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \\\n           (player_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \\\n           (player_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):\n            return 'You win!'\n        return 'You lose!'\n```\n\nNow, let's create the `index.html` file:\n\ntemplates/index.html\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>\n    <form method=\"POST\">\n        <button name=\"choice\" value=\"rock\">Rock</button>\n        <button name=\"choice\" value=\"paper\">Paper</button>\n        <button name=\"choice\" value=\"scissors\">Scissors</button>\n    </form>\n    {% if player_choice %}\n        <p>You chose {{ player_choice }}.
